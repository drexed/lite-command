# Lite::Command

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/lite-command.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/lite-command)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drexed/lite-command.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drexed/lite-command)

Lite::Command provides an API for building simple and complex command based service objects.
It provides extensions for handling errors and memoization to improve your object workflow productivity.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lite-command'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lite-command

## Setup

`rails g command NAME` will generate the following file:

```erb
app/commands/[NAME]_command.rb
```

If a `ApplicationCommand` file in the `app/commands` directory is available, the
generator will create file that inherit from `ApplicationCommand` if not it will
fallback to `Lite::Command::Complex`.

## Simple

Simple commands are a traditional command service call objects.
It only exposes a `call` method that returns a value.

**Setup**

```ruby
class CalculatePower < Lite::Command::Simple

  # NOTE: This `execute` class method is required to use with call
  def self.execute(a, b)
    a**b
  end

end
```

**Callers**

```ruby
CalculatePower.execute(2, 2) #=> 4

# - or -

CalculatePower.call(2, 3) #=> 8
```

## Complex

Complex commands are powerful command service call objects.
It can be extended to use error, memoization, and propagation mixins.

**Setup**

```ruby
class SearchMovies < Lite::Command::Complex

  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  # NOTE: This `execute` instance method is required to use with call
  def execute
    { generate_fingerprint => movies_by_name }
  end

  private

  def movies_by_name
    HTTP.get("http://movies.com?title=#{name}")
  end

  def generate_fingerprint
    Digest::MD5.hexdigest(movies_by_name)
  end

end
```

**Caller**

```ruby
SearchMovies.execute('Toy Story') #=> { 'fingerprint_1' => [ 'Toy Story 1', ... ] }

# - or -

command = SearchMovies.new('Toy Story')
command.called? #=> false
command.call    #=> { 'fingerprint_1' => [ 'Toy Story 1', ... ] }
command.called? #=> true

# - or -

command = SearchMovies.call('Toy Story')
command.called? #=> true
command.call    #=> { 'fingerprint_1' => [ 'Toy Story 1', ... ] }
```

**Result**

```ruby
command = SearchMovies.new('Toy Story')
command.result  #=> nil

command.call    #=> { 'fingerprint_1' => [ 'Toy Story 1', ... ] }
command.result  #=> { 'fingerprint_1' => [ 'Toy Story 1', ... ] }

command.recall! #=> Clears the `call`, `cache`, `errors` variables and then re-performs the call
command.result  #=> { 'fingerprint_2' => [ 'Toy Story 2', ... ] }
```

## Procedure

Procedures are used to run a collection of commands. It uses the the complex procedure API
so it has access to all the methods. The `execute` method is already defined to
handle most common procedure steps. It can be use directly or subclassed.

**Setup**

```ruby
class SearchChannels < Lite::Command::Procedure; end
```

```ruby
commands = [DisneyChannel.new, EspnChannel.new(current_station), MtvChannel.new]

procedure = SearchChannels.call(*commands)
procedure.result #=> ['disney: #3', 'espn: #59', 'mtv: #212']
procedure.steps  #=> [<DisneyChannel  @result="...">, <EspnChannel @result="...">, <MtvChannel  @result="...">]

# - or -

# If the errors extension is added you can stop the procedure at first failure.
procedure = SearchChannels.new(*commands)
procedure.exit_on_failure = true
procedure.call
procedure.result #=> ['disney: #3']
procedure.failed_steps #=> [{ index: 1, step: 2, name: 'ErrorChannel', args: [current_station], errors: ['field error message'] }]
```

## Extensions

Extend complex (and procedures) base command with any of the following extensions:

### Errors (optional)

Learn more about using [Lite::Errors](https://github.com/drexed/lite-errors)

**Setup**

```ruby
class SearchMovies < Lite::Command::Complex
  include Lite::Command::Extensions::Errors

  # ... ommited ...

  private

  # Add a explicit and/or exception errors to the error pool
  def generate_fingerprint
    if movies_by_name.nil?
      errors.add(:fingerprint, 'invalid md5 request value')
    else
      Digest::MD5.hexdigest(movies_by_name)
    end
  rescue ArgumentError => exception
    merge_exception!(exception, key: :custom_error_key)
  end

end
```

**Instance Callers**

```ruby
command = SearchMovies.call('Toy Story')
command.errors    #=> Lite::Errors::Messages object

command.validate! #=> Raises Lite::Command::ValidationError if it has any errors
command.valid?    #=> Alias for validate!

command.errored?  #=> false
command.success?  #=> true
command.failure?  #=> Checks that it has been called and has errors
command.status    #=> :failure

command.result!   #=> Raises Lite::Command::ValidationError if it has any errors, if not it returns the result

# Use the following to merge errors from other commands or models
# with the default direction being `:from`
command.merge_errors!(command_2)
user_model.merge_errors!(command, direction: :to)
```

**Block Callers**

```ruby
# Useful for controllers or actions that depend on states.
SearchMovies.perform('Toy Story') do |result, success, failure|
  success.call { redirect_to(movie_path, notice: "Movie can be found at: #{result}") }
  failure.call { redirect_to(root_path, notice: "Movie cannot be found at: #{result}") }
end
```

### Propagation (optional)

Propagation methods help you perform an action on an object. If successful is
returns the result else it adds the object errors to the form object. Available
propagation methods are:
  - `assign_and_return!(object, params)`
  - `create_and_return!(klass, params)`
  - `update_and_return!(object, params)`
  - `destroy_and_return!(object)`
  - `archive_and_return!(object)` (if using Lite::Archive)
  - `save_and_return!(object)`

**Setup**

```ruby
class SearchMovies < Lite::Command::Complex
  include Lite::Command::Extensions::Errors
  include Lite::Command::Extensions::Propagation

  # ... ommited ...

  def execute
    create_and_return!(User, name: 'John Doe')
  end

end
```

### Memoize (optional)

Learn more about using [Lite::Memoize](https://github.com/drexed/lite-memoize)

**Setup**

```ruby
class SearchMovies < Lite::Command::Complex
  include Lite::Command::Extensions::Memoize

  # ... ommited ...

  private

  # Sets the value in the cache
  # Subsequent method calls gets the cached value
  # This saves you the extra external HTTP.get call
  def movies_by_name
    cache.memoize { HTTP.get("http://movies.com?title=#{name}") }
  end

  # Gets the value in the cache
  def generate_fingerprint
    Digest::MD5.hexdigest(movies_by_name)
  end

end
```

**Callers**

```ruby
command = SearchMovies.call('Toy Story')
command.cache #=> Lite::Memoize::Instance object
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
